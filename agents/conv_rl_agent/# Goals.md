# Goals

Research abstract:

- Clarity of presentation (good writing, includes figures, etc)

- Relevance for the school theme (this includes work in any of the domains touched by the summer school: from core machine learning & computer vision to core neuroscience, and everything in between)

- Properly contextualising the work within the literature (briefly discussing related work)

- Experiments if any, interpretation of the results, and conclusion

- (bonus) Novelty

# Hints

- The extended abstract can be structured as a short paper, i.e., it can have sections (e.g., Intro, Method, Experiments, References, etc.), and it can include images, figures, tables, etc.

- The extended abstract must not exceed two pages, excluding references.

# Plan

Today

- read through and extract methods from papers:

- kaggle Lux AI submission
- Stone Tao submission
- Starcraft submission
- Deepmind diplomacy game

Related works and Methodology

Tomorrow

- Try to apply described methods to my current implementation. Analyze it
- Submit current implementation

On Saturday
---------------------

-----------------------------------------------
Papers should come from questions, so question are:

1. What is the difference between Star Craft (the most famous up untill now challenge) and Lux AI?

- paper I downloaded

2. Why action space in Lux AI is claimed to be large, comparing to other similar challenges?

- youtube tutorial on Lux AI

3. Are main challenges I identified previously correct?

- youtube tutorial

4. What objective/hypothesis I would have and how I will evaluate created solution? (it means, that I will need to read more about metrics)

- Compare ...
- Create ...
- Evaluate ...
